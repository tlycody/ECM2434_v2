Game overview
We decided to play BINGO
-There are 9 games (details attached below).
-When a user completes a task, it turns into a stamp, and they earn points.
-Each game is worth a set number of points and requires either visiting a location or uploading a picture.
-For location-based tasks, players must scan a QR code to verify they have been there.
-Players can earn bonus points for completing tasks in a specific pattern (explanation attached below).
-The game has a time limit of one month.
Players who complete all 9 games within:
⁠Week 1 earn an extra 40 points
